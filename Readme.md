# Learning Python Variables and Number Methods

## Introduction

This README.md file serves as a guide for learning about Python variables and common number methods.

## Python Variables

Variables in Python can hold data of different types, including numbers, lists, dictionaries, strings, sets, and more. Here's a brief overview:

- **Number**: Represents numerical data, including integers, floats, and complex numbers.
- **List**: Ordered collection of items that can be of different types.
- **Dictionary**: Collection of key-value pairs.
- **Tuple**: Immutable ordered collection of items.
- **Boolean**: Represents truth values, True or False.
- **String**: Represents text, enclosed within single or double quotes.
- **Set**: Unordered collection of unique items.
- **File**: Used to perform operations on files.
- **None**: Represents the absence of a value or a null value.

## Python Number Methods

### append()

Adds an element to the end of a list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
